    "## Background and Circular statistic\n",
    "Circular statistics has been applied in many area like public disorder, wind direction but rarely be adopted in cyber security research. The paper analyze the IP packet enter and exit monitoring points on networks. It is used to analyze the distribution of random variable which are cyclic in nature. We thus consider the time of attcking as a random variable, and map the day to a 24-hour circle. Why we consider to use circular statistic here is because if we record at 23:30, 00:15, 00:30, 00:45, the mean value of these four times is 06:15 while the true mean time should allocate in 00:15.\n",

The paper select the top three countries which experience the most attacks and UK (the author's country).\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This paper shows that how circular statistics can be applied to the cyber security. It visualizes the daily and weekly time pattern such that we can infer the malwares' behaviors, which can help allocate the resources to mitigate attacks in an efficient manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper points out the hypothesis of uniform distribution of attacks is not necessarily right. Malwares can be active in different time periods during a day and the time patterns may related to the working time of human-beings. This finding can help the decision makers to secure the data more efficiently and lower down the cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the paper only analyze a very short peroid of time (Aug 8th-16th 2016) which may not be representative. It needs more data to evaluate the real varaiation of malwares."

    "### Where is Economics\n",
    "Since the paper make the visualization of the variation of the malware attacks in a cyclic time pattern, it can help users to recogize the peek and down time of the attacks. Security IT thus can allocate proper resource to pretect data from attacks, which can help to reduce the  cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the paper shows that the time patterns are also related to the total amount of attacks. The attacks shows bimodality when a large volume of attacks and present multi-modelity when the attacks happening a lower rate. Understand the distributions of the patterns of the attacks can help improve the security and save redundant cost."

    "### Applied Ecomomic Models \n",
    "We can use the \"Matching problem: Valuations\" in class. If a product can alloate the resource automatically with the time varations of the attackers, the valuation of the product will increase. While users are willing to paying more for the product, the product can bring more surplus for its company. On the other hand, users(or companies) who buy the product or adopt the circular statistic can protect the data in an efficient manner. It will help the company to cut the cost on security and reduce the risk of losing data. In conclude, the study can help each individaul, company and the whole country promote their performance on both security and ecomomics."
