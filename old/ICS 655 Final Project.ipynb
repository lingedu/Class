    "Since they use the make the visualization of the variation of the malware attacks based on a time pattern, it can help users to recogize the peek and down time of the attacks. Security IT thus can allocate proper resouce in pretecting data from attacks, which can help to reduce the  cost in security and contribute to good pretection.\n",
    "Besides, the paper also show that the time pattern are related to the total amount of attacks. The attacks shows bimodality when a large volume of attacks and present multi-modelity when the attacks happening a lower rate. "
